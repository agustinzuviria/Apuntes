        <h1>Structure: This is a Main Heading, first element of the Body of the Page</h1>
	    	<p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
        <h2>This is a Sub-Heading. You may also call it a level 2 heading </h2>
            <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings
                (or lower-level headings). </p>

        <h3>This is a Level 3 Heading</h3>

        <p> <dfn>White space </dfn> means that when the browser           comes across
            two
            or
            more          spaces next to each other, or a line break, it treats that
            as a single space. This is known as white space collapsing. </p>
