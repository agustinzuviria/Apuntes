        <h1>What is this project?</h1> 

            <p>This is an HTML page that I created in TextEdit. It is fully based on the Book HTML & CSS design and build web sites by Jon Duckett,
            and it's website https://www.htmlandcssbook.com/ </p>

        <h1>Structure: This is a Main Heading, first element of the Body of the Page</h1>
	    	<p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
        <h2>This is a Sub-Heading. You may also call it a level 2 heading </h2>
            <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings
                (or lower-level headings). </p>
            <p> This content is <em> important </em> </p>
            <p> This is not </p>
            <p> Anything within the body of a web page is displayed in the main browser window. </p>
        <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
	    	<p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
        <h3>This is a Level 3 Heading</h3>
        <h4>This is a Level 4 Heading</h4>
        <h5>This is a Level 5 Heading</h5>
        <h6>This is a Level 6 Heading. There are only 6 leves.</h6>



        <h1>Text</h1>

        <p>This is how we make a word appear <b>bold.</b> </p>   
        <p>This is how we make a word appear <strong>strong.</strong> </p>  
        <p>This is how we make a word appear <i>Italic.</i> </p>

        I think <em>Ivy</em> was the first.     <br />

        <h2>White Space </h2>
        <p> When the browser           comes across
            two
            or
            more          spaces next to each other, or a line break, it treats that
            as a single space. This is known as white space collapsing. </p>
